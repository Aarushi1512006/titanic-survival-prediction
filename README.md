# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository explores various machine learning techniques to solve the classic Titanic survival classification problem. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the shipwreck based on features like age, gender, and socio-economic status.

## 📈 Project Overview
I am implementing and comparing multiple classification algorithms to determine the most effective approach for this dataset.

### Models Implemented:
- [x] Logistic Regression (Baseline)
- [X] Decision Tree
- [X] NaiveBayes
- [X] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- [ ] Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📊 Model Performance Comparison
As I experiment with different classifiers, I track their performance metrics here:

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logistic Regression** | 0.80 | 0.74 | 0.77 | 0.75 |
| **Decision Tree** | 0.80 | 0.73 | 0.78 | 0.76 |
| **Naive Bayes** | 0.78 | 0.68 | 0.78 | 0.73 |
| **KNN** | 0.81 | 0.78 | 0.71 | 0.74 |
